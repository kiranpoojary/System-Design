# The Problem of Distributed Consensus

In this video by Gaurav Sen, he introduces the concept of Paxos, a distributed consensus protocol. Paxos is an algorithm designed to achieve consensus in distributed systems where individual components can fail, and messages may be dropped during communication.

Key points covered in the video:

1. **Consensus** : Paxos aims to achieve consensus in a distributed system, specifically a majority consensus. This means that more than half of the nodes in the system must agree on a particular value.
2. **Distributed Nature** : Paxos operates in a distributed environment where components can fail, and messages may not always be delivered.
3. **Use Cases** : Paxos is used in various popular systems, including Apache Zookeeper and Google Chubby, mainly for distributed locking and maintaining order in distributed logs.
4. **Importance** : Distributed consensus, especially in the presence of failures and timeouts, is a challenging problem. Paxos offers a solution where consensus is achieved with the agreement of more than half of the nodes.
5. **Prerequisites** : Gaurav suggests reviewing topics like data consistency, isolation levels, two-phase commits, and quorum to better understand the challenges of distributed consensus.

The video sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the Paxos algorithm, its practical use cases, and its applications in systems like distributed locking and log management. Paxos is highlighted as a valuable tool for maintaining consistency and order in distributed systems, even in the face of failures and unpredictable message delivery.
